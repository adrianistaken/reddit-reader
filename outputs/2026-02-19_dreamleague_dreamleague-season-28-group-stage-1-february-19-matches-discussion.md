> This tournament is really demonstrating how much every team lives or dies on the team concept itself. Once a team isn't sure what their identity or strategic understanding of the patch is, any member of that team can look terrible at a given moment. 
> 
> You can see that with Spirit: Panto and Mirele are struggling, but they've both done much better with the same squad in the past. Now they look especially weak with the drafting/strategy falling apart, as Insania and SVG have highlighted. 
> 
> And Aurora also prove that in reverse: Lorenof completes the team in a way that Mikoto doesn't. And so everyone in the team looks much more complete and in sync right now, even if the gap between Lorenof and Mikoto itself isn't nearly as large as the team gap in performance with each player.

> Aurora is the most inform team right now. Theres no way Mikoto gets his spot back considering how much their gameplay and confidence skyrocketed with Lorenof.
> 
> Parivision are looking fanstastic so far. Replacing DM with SSS was a damn good move. SSS brought that slickness and freshness which Parivison badly needeed.
> 
> Yandex are looking rather disoriented and not on point. Probably burnt out.
> 
> Mouz look rested and are slowly returning to their previous form.
> 
> Betboom are finally starting to figure out the drafts that suit their playstyle.
> 
> Spirit are held back by Mirele and Pantos poor performances it looks like. Yatoro has also seen better days...
> 
> OG are overcomplicating things and look a bit confused with their drafting, they seem to get outdrafted in most of their games. However, they still have one of the best team coordination out of all teams.
> 
> Navi is a literal definition of an underdog team, they can beat anyone.
> 
> Falcons and Liquid are two best teams right now probably.

- u/aktivera (score: 11): They also replaced TorontoTokyo -> Ws and Oli -> Kaori. I don't think they have actually played with the current lineup with Mikoto.  **edit:** Okay, they actually played Dreamleague qualifiers with current lineup (with Mikoto) and came 2nd to Betboom. Then they qualified through DreamLeague Division 2 instead (with Lorenof).   Still, that's was their first attempt with the new lineup. I don't think it's only Lorenof making them good now, he probably contributes but still worth pointing out that they did more changes recently than just using Lorenof.
