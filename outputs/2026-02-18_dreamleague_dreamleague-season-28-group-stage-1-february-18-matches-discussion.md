> I really hopw this was the last tournament that tbey play without a coach.They need a person who watch replays and the enemy,who makes drafts and who knows meta.For an org so big like TS,this is only common sense.Or,at least,it should be.

- u/Wrong-Ganache-3973 (score: 1): I'm saying, feels like they just had a long break then got shocked since Blast but hopefully, they're coming into form. A good ramp up into the big tournaments is better rather than peaking early like they did last year.
