They should've taken a proper break and focus on fewer tournaments, especially when they have someone from another side of the globe. Can't imagine the months being away from home being good on his old bones.

### 6. u/KyoujinOuji (score: 7)
> Honestly this isn't even Saberlight's fault, you could remove ATF from Falcons and replace him with literal Jesus and Falcons would play worse. ATF is such a core component to that team that it really makes no difference who replaces him. Couple this with Liquid activating literal God Mode in the past few days and yeah, you get this sad show.
