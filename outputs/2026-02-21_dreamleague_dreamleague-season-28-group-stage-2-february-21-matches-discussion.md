One can say "they were pretty well on group stage," buy when comes down to important games, the team is so trash. i think this team wont get anhy expressive result this year and it makes me fell happy.

### 17. u/Soldirk (score: 0)
> That was very disconnected by XG. They have very low dmg and instead of focusing on one hero at a time, they keep on spreading and looking for their own fight. Ame and NTS were playing very poorly. Ame timewalked towards Razor for what? And end up wasting his Chrono. And then NTS tried chasing Mars instead of regrouping with the team to kill clock faster? You're a puck! Sadly, Xxs was thrown away with that early primal pick. Overall, XG draft is lackluster, they do have a chance with that draft but they played very poorly to pull it off.
