They decided that he shouldn’t but also wouldn’t. Except he’s a known omni pos 1 player? Does nobody remember Nightfall omni carry?

Na'vi got to grand finals last event and they didn't make gs2 this event

According to him, noone kept talking and trying to force some view and didn't coming along with the team strategy. The last season result got over his head indeed. He ask for last pick and delivered a horrendous gameplay.
